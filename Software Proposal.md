## 1. Background
Student safety is a critical concern for academic institutions. Many campuses struggle to provide students with quick access to emergency services and real-time safety updates. To address this, we propose the Campus Safety App, a mobile solution designed to improve campus security. The app will give students essential tools to connect with campus security and emergency services quickly, creating a safer and more secure environment.

## 2. Objectives
- Provide real-time access to emergency contacts and campus security updates.
- Facilitate immediate response through features like a panic button and live chat.
- Enhance situational awareness with a real-time safety map and geolocation sharing.
- Reduce response times during emergencies by integrating advanced notification systems.
- Improve campus-wide safety culture through accessible and reliable technology.

## 3. Project Description and Scope
### Proposed Features:
- **Panic Button:** Allows students to send an immediate distress signal to campus security with their geolocation.
- **Live Chat:** Enables real-time communication with security personnel.
