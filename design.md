# Process Model

## What Process Model are we using and why?

We’re using the _Agile process model_. This is because it is flexible, iterative, and is the most suitable for our time constraint. It also allows for simultaneous working on deliverables.

# Scenario Analysis

## Scenario 1: Emergency Contact Access

### Situation:

A student witnesses a suspicious incident on campus late at night and needs to report it immediately.

### User Actions:

1. The student opens the app and selects the "Emergency Contacts" feature from the home screen.
2. The app displays a list of emergency numbers, including campus security, local police, and a 24/7 helpline.
3. The student taps the "Call Campus Security" button to report the incident.

### Challenges:

- Ensuring the app loads quickly in stressful situations.

## Scenario 2: Campus Security Update Notification

### Situation:

A power outage affects a part of the campus, raising safety concerns for students in nearby areas.

### User Actions:

2. The student opens the app to read detailed instructions and safety tips, such as avoiding dark areas and using alternative routes.
3. The app provides a map highlighting affected zones and safe pathways.

### Challenges:

- Ensuring timely and reliable delivery of notifications.
- Balancing the volume of notifications to avoid overwhelming users.

### Opportunities:

- Incorporate location-based notifications for proximity-specific alerts.
